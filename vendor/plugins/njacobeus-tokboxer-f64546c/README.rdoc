= TokBoxer

* http://github.com/njacobeus/tokboxer/

== DESCRIPTION:

This is a ruby implementation of the TokBox API. Tokbox is a free video calling / video mailing platform (see http://www.tokbox.com).

All API methods specified in the Tokbox Developer API wiki (http://developers.tokbox.com/index.php/API) are implemented but not all objects yet. So you may have to dig into the hash returned by the call (XML converted to a Ruby hash).

For the moment, this gem currently specifically serves our needs for the implementation of video conversations and video mails on iStockCV (www.istockcv.com), an online recruitment network which we are developing. Your needs may vary so feel free to contact me (nj@belighted.com).

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Features currently available:

  * Create a guest user or register a user on TokBox

  * Get information about a user

  * Create a call

  * Retrieve the list of vmails for a user

  * Generate embed codes for a player, a recorder, and a call

* Limitations:

  * For the moment, the Call and VMail objects are quite simple (they only hold an id)

  * No tests yet (ouch)

== SYNOPSIS:

  # To create an instance of the API object:

  api  = TokBoxer::Api.new(partner_key, partner_secret, api_server_url) # defaults to "http://sandbox.tokbox.com/"

  # To create a user instance:

  user = api.create_guest_user
  # or
  user = api.register_user(firstname, lastname, email)
  # or if you have already created a user previously on TokBox
  user = api.create_user(user_jabber_id, user_secret)

  # To get info about the user object:

  user.access_token_valid? # returns true or false whether the secret of the user is correct or not
  user.is_online?
  user.display_name
  user.username
  user.userid
  user.show

  # To embed a player or a recorder:
  
  user.recorder_embed_code(width, height)           # returns the HTML for embedding a recorder
  user.player_embed_code(message_id, width, height) # returns the HTML for embedding a player for a specific message

  # To create a call:

  call = user.create_call("My full name") # set "true" as 2nd param if you want it persistent
  call.embed_code                         # returns the HTML for embedding the call in a web page

  # To manipulate vmails:

  user.vmails          # returns an array of VMail objects for all the vmails in the user's feed
  user.sent_vmails     # returns an array of VMail objects for sent vmails only
  user.received_vmails # returns an array of VMail objects for received vmails only

== REQUIREMENTS:

* xml-simple
* A partner key and a partner secret at Tokbox (you can get those here: http://developers.tokbox.com/index.php/Main_Page)

== INSTALL:
